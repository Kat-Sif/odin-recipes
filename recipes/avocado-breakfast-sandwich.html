    <h3>Chef Tips</h3>
        <p> Double recipe to make two sandwiches, which would increase avocado to one full avocado versus a half. 
            You can also use one full avocado on one sandwich if you are like me and love avocados!</p>

        <p>Substitute sourdough bread for the Italian bread, if desired. American cheese can be used in place of Cheddar cheese.</p>
