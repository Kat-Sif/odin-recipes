    <h3>Overnight Oats</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 to 1/2 cup liquid such as dairy milk, almond, cashew or coconut milk</li>
        
        <li>1/3 to 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
        
        <li>1/3 to 1/2 cup yogurt, optional</li>
            
        <li>1 teaspoon chia seeds, optional but highly recommended</li>
            
        <li>1/2 banana, mashed, optional</li>
            
        <li>Serving suggestions: fruit (fresh or dried), nuts, nut butter, seeds, 
            protein powder, granola, coconut, spices, citrus zest and vanilla extract</li>       
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the desired amounts of milk, oats, yogurt, 
            chia seeds and banana to a jar or container and give them a good stir. 
            Refrigerate overnight or for at least 5 hours.</li>
        <li>In the morning, add additional liquid if you'd like. Once you achieve the desired consistency, 
            top with fruit, nuts, nut butter, seeds, protein powder, 
            granola, coconut, spices, zest or vanilla extract. </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Chef's Note</h3>
        <p>The mixture will keep for up to 2 days. 
            If you don't add the banana, up to 4 days. 
            However, once you are experienced, you'll have no problem whipping up another batch midweek if needed!</p>
