    <h3>Egg-in-a-Hole Sandwich</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices thick-cut peppered bacon</li>
        
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        
        <li>Jalape√±o-style hot sauce, as needed</li>
            
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            
        <li>4 slices Texas toast</li>
            
        <li>4 tablespoons salted butter</li>
        
        <li>4 large eggs</li>

        <li>4 slices pepper jack cheese</li>

        <li>1 small tomato, sliced</li>

        <li>Green leaf lettuce, for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large cast-iron skillet over medium heat, 
            cook the bacon until crisp, 12 to 14 minutes. 
            Remove to a plate and set aside. 
            Drain the grease from the skillet but do not clean. 
            When cool enough to handle, tear the bacon slices in half.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix the mayonnaise and hot sauce to taste in a small bowl. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>sing a biscuit cutter or the rim of a glass, cut a hole in the center of each Texas toast slice.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in the bacon skillet and add 2 of the Texas toast slices. Toast the bread slightly, 
            1 to 2 minutes. Crack an egg into the hole in each piece of toast and sprinkle the eggs with salt and pepper. 
            Cook the eggs until set on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a spatula, carefully flip the toast with the egg, 
            season the other side and spread with the mayonnaise mixture. 
            Top each with a slice of cheese to slightly melt and cook until the egg is the desired doneness. 
            Remove to a cutting board and repeat with the remaining butter, toast, eggs, mayo mixture and cheese.</li>
        <li>To build the sandwiches, divide the bacon between 2 of the egg-in-a-hole toast pieces, 
            on top of the cheese. Top each with some tomato slices and lettuce, 
            then top with a remaining egg-in-a-hole toast piece. 
            Serve immediately or wrap in foil to keep warm.</li>
    </ol>
