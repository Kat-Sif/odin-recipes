    <p>Hello, my name is Kat. I have created this list of recipes to help me eat better. Here are some things about me and why I chose to create this recipe list.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I don't eat much but I want to eat more.</li>
        <li>I don't have much of an appetite for food in general so well put together meals are best</li>
        <li>I really like fruit!</li>
        <li>Seasonings make everything taste so much better</li>
        <li>Eating healthy is a requirement but not but something I should stress over</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are listed some good breakfast recipes, most contain eggs though, but I seem to be fine to eat a lot of them in a day.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><a href="recipes/overnight-oats.html">Overnight Oats</a></li>
        <li><a href="recipes/tortilla-breakfast-wrap.html">Tortilla Breakfast Wrap</a></li>
        <li><a href="recipes/egg-in-a-hole-sandwich.html">Egg-in-a-Hole Sandwich</a></li>
        <li><a href="recipes/avocado-breakfast-sandwich.html">Avocado Breakfast Sandwich</a></li>
        <li><a href="recipes/best-breakfast-potatoes-ever.html">Best Breakfast Potatoes Ever</a></li>
        
        
        
    </ol>
    <p>All five recipes are perfect for breakfast.</p>
    <p>A good side dish to eat with any of these is some diced tomatoes and an avocado, salt and peppered with olive oil.</p>
